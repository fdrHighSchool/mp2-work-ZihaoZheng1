# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * Take a as the starting point from the provided string to take out all subsequent strings

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * From the provided string, take a as the starting point and take all the following strings until reached b (excluding b)

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * Find the index of str in the given string, if str does not exist in the given string, it will return-1

  * `.equals(str)`
    * Used to test whether the given string is the same as str


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * This for uses the length of s to decide how many times to repeat the run
